## MilsimWisdoms

# About
This is a guide, based on experiences I, and people I know, have had with Arma 3 Milsim units. While this guide is tailored to them (Starsim units in particular), it is broadly applicable to any online, hierarchical group.

# Disclaimer
A large portion of this guide was not originally created by me, and I have a lot of gratitude to the several people that I have ~~plagiarised~~ borrowed this work from.
Take everything in this guide with a small mountain of salt, nobody (even hyper-intelligent gods like myself make mistakes).

# TLDR
Milsim's inherent flaws make it a breeding ground for stress and toxicity. Without keeping a great deal of factors in-check, the unit is destined to crash and burn.
